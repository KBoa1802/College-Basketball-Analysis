# College Basketball Analysis (2024)
This repository contains an in-depth statistical analysis of the 2024 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball season. The project focuses on analyzing key performance metrics such as offensive and defensive efficiency, three-point shooting performance, and the correlation between turnovers and wins. Additionally, the analysis explores the impact of financial allocations to athletics on team success.

 # Key Features:

Offensive & Defensive Efficiency by Conference: Analyzed the average adjusted offensive (ADJOE) and defensive efficiency (ADJDE) by conference, identifying the SEC as the top offensive conference and the Big 12 as the best defensive conference.

3-Point Shooting Analysis: Investigated the correlation between 3-point shooting percentages and playoff performance, finding that over 70% of playoff teams shoot better than the league average.
Turnovers & Wins Correlation: Examined the relationship between turnovers and wins, visualizing the correlation using scatter plots and regression lines.

T-Test Comparison (SEC vs. Non-SEC): Performed a t-test to compare offensive efficiency between SEC teams and non-SEC teams, revealing a statistically significant difference.

Financial Analysis: Integrated financial data to explore the relationship between money allocated to athletics and offensive efficiency, finding little correlation among SEC teams.
The analysis uses R, with libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, and stringr for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling.
